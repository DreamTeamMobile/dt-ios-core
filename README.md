# DreamTeam Core iOS

## What?

This is the set of extensions, frames, sources and other things that could be useful in iOS app development.

This repository will be really helpful in MVVM architecture because it contains:

* `@Bindable` property wrapper
* `ButtonFrame`, `InputFrame`, and other frames – tiny view models – abstractions of UI controls
* Base and Bindable classes – boilerplates for your projects
* Router implementation

## How?
